Github:

oracc is a group

individual oracc maintainers have personal IDs, e.g., stinney

status of 'oradmin' account on github is not clear

ssh-key for oradmin needs to be installed as key for a user with
	access to the github projects, e.g., stinney

---

Users:

oradmin user on build-oracc:
	uses shell=osh
	can be logged into by oracc maintainer
	but not by project users, e.g., ogsl
	can build any project or subproject

project users:
	use shell=osh
	do not have .ssh id
	can be logged into by oracc users whose id_rsa.pub is in the .ssh/authorized_keys
	can only rebuild their own project or subprojects

---

/home/oracc - owned by oradmin:www-data and +s bit set

ogsl.git - anywhere on github ; must be accessible to oradmin

/home/oracc/ogsl - git cloned by oradmin with oradmin:www-data owner

---

osh - oracc-shell; default shell for oradmin and all project users, e.g., ogsl

odo - oracc-do: command interpreter for oracc runs suid oradmin; called by osh if there is a command

orc - oracc-remote-command: cli to log in to oracc server and run command

---

orc dev ogsl build

ssh -C ogsl@dev build

ssh authentication ensures only ogsl project workers can perform operations

osh gets:

 -c build

osh does:

odo USER PROJECT COMMAND

odo (running as oradmin) does:

 (cd ogsl ; git pull ; oscx-build.sh)

---

oracc projects need to be initialized by being cloned in /home/oracc

---

some projects don't need their own userid

odo oradmin [project] build

ssh oradmin [project] build

do something like:
if [ user=oradmin ]
   shift
   project=$1
fi

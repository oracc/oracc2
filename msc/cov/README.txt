msc/cov: coverage scripts

These scripts compute the coverage of sign lists and Unicode
definitions. The front end scripts are designed for use in projects;
the remaining scripts are helpers.

    cbdneeduni.sh  -- list signs in a CBD that are not in Unicode

    crpneeduni.sh  -- list signs in a corpus that are not in Unicode

    cslneedsign.sh -- list signs in a corpus that did not make it into
    		      the corpus-sign-list

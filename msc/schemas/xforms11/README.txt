This directory file contains a first draft of an XHTML + XForms 1.1 RelaxNG Schema, expressed in RelaxNG compact syntax.

Here is a list of the files included, and a brief description of what they do:

* xhtml+xforms.rnc
This is the RNC schema to associate with XHTML+XForms documents.

* xforms-nons-11.rnc
Proposed changes to the existing published schema at http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/#schema

* xforms-navindex.rnc
An optional module to include in xhtml-xforms.rnc to add the navindex
attribute to form controls, useful for validation of the XForms 1.1
test suite.  It is possible the final XHTM+XForms integration will use
only XHTML's tabindex attribute.

* xforms-11.rnc
Copied from from published schema at http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/#schema
Includes proposed changes to add xforms repeat attribute definitions.

* xml-events-2.rnc
As yet not used.

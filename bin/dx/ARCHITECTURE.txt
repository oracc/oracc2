		ORACC TASK ARCHITECTURE (OTA)
		=============================

The OTA defines how Oracc users carry out Oracc tasks such as building
projects or generating various kinds of outputs.

Tasks are carried out by odo (Oracc Do).  Odo only works if the CWD is
an Oracc project directory (on a Unix server, /home/oracc/PROJECT or
/home/oracc/PROJECT/SUBPROJECT+).

On a single-user Oracc installation odo can be called directly from
the command line.

On a multi-user Oracc installation odo, users invoke odo through the
osh, the Oracc shell.  Osh has built-in commands and external
commands: the external commands are passed to the Oracc daemon, dx,
which runs as user oradmin and is able to executey the commands in the
/home/oracc space.

Osh can also be invoked via ssh, which is how most Oracc users will
interact with it. This interaction is controlled by an Oracc Remote
Client, or orc; orcs are easy to implement because they need almost no
intelligence: they only need to send osh commands via ssh; receive
status and filename information; and optionally retrieve log files and
other outputs.

Sanitization
The URL and form data needs to be sanitized for invalid characters. A “blacklist” of characters is an option but it may be difficult to think of all of the characters to validate against. Also there may be some that were not discovered as of yet. A “white list” containing only allowable characters or command list should be created to validate the user input. Characters that were missed, as well as undiscovered threats, should be eliminated by this list.

Genereal blacklist to be included for commannd injection can be |  ; & $ > < ' \  ! >> #

Escape or filter special characters for windows,   ( ) < > & * ‘ | = ? ; [ ] ^ ~ ! . ” % @ / \ : + , `
Escape or filter special characters for Linux, { }  ( ) < > & * ‘ | = ? ; [ ]  $ – # ~ ! . ” %  / \ : + , `

BACKGROUND
**********

Before getting into details, it may be useful to know that the
structure of a zoomed result is the same as an unzoomed result: the
zoom reduces the results to a single heading from the metadata, and
then applies exactly the same page selection as for an unzoomed page.
This means that the UI code for glossary-article-texts already
contains much of what we need, and whatever that does with the results
of calling the oracc server's page maker should be mostly or
completely the same for zoomed versus unzoomed pages.


PATH TO THE INSTANCE LIST PAGES
*******************************

This path is for ePSD2 on oracc.museum because that is known good and
doesn't use the new implementation.  This means that while we are
working on the new implementation on build-oracc we still have a
reasonable reference point for what should be happending.

 1) go to https://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/sux
 2) search 'lugal king'
 3) click on 'lugal[king]N'
 4) click on '49942 Instances' in top right
 5) Now we are at the page where the left pane has zoom links

The analogy in the oracc-search-front-end is:

 1) search for 'king'
 2) sort by Hits
 3) click on lugal king, 3rd down
 4) click on '1. king (711x/97%)'
 

A-LINK JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS
***************************

The outline pane now has a JS function of the form:

 p3zoomgx(PROJECT,GLOSSARY,XIS,ZOOMINDEX)

You don't need the PROJECT for the current oracc-search-front-end,
because PROJECT is always NEO.

You should be able to parse this in a manner analagous to
handleTermClick in
glossary-article-texts/glossary-article-texts.component.ts

This function looks like it handles a-links of the form:

  <a class="icount" href="javascript:distprof2('gudea','sux','sux.r00002d')">35 instances</a>

and parses out the arguments from the javascript function.

In the outline pane--for reasons I don't understand and which I won't
fix today--I did things slightly differently and the a-link is:

  <a href="javascript://" onclick="p3zoomgx('gudea','sux','sux.r00002d',1)" data-zoom="1">

But you should be able to use the same parse but add a final
queryParam for the integer that is the zoom index.


URLS TO SEND TO SERVER
**********************

You can then build a URL that is analogous to other XIS URLS; for
GLOSSARY=sux:

 /neo/sux?xis=XIS&zoom=ZOOMINDEX

You can also include a page in that URL--this is done elsewhere in the
UI to implement the prev/next arrows to page through the results:

 /neo/sux?xis=XIS&zoom=ZOOMINDEX&page=PAGE

This would come from the same counter as the UI already uses.


THINGS NOT YET DONE
*******************

There is another control, ALL RESULTS, which sets zoom to zero; I
haven't updated that to the new system yet because it is embedded in
the page template. I can do that without too much difficulty next week.

When you get the instance list you should be able to click on the text
labels to see the text edition in context; this is broken in the new
implementation and will require some work to fix it--I'll start on
that next week but it probably won't be functional until the end of
the first week of April.

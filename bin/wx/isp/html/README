DO NOT EDIT p3-template.xml

At this phase of development, isp processes the installed
p3-template.xml and does both the p3-pager stream edits and its own,
adding data- XXX nodes and rewriting some of links etc.  The idea is
to remain as compatible as possible with P3 during the transition.

The copy of p3-template.xml here is to try to prevent me from editing
the one in the oracc1 repo and messing things up as a result.

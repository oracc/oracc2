P4 Image Support:=
==================

In addition to the standard access to CDLI, P4 has two features for
local image support: the External Image Cache (EIC) and Oracc's Own
Images (OOI).

All OOI are in .png format. EIC are in the format of the cached
original.

Per-project images continue to be managed via 00res as usual.

OOI access is via metadata and/or config options; cache support is not
generally enabled.

Implementation:=
================

Filesystem:-
------------

In the filesystem images live in @@ORACC@@, e.g., /home/oracc. The
cache is in /home/oracc/eic and OOI is in /home/oracc/ooi. Images are
stored by X/P directories in a flatter version of Oracc tiering in
which only the top (short) tiering is used. Thus, P123455.jpg and
P123456.jpg will both be in /home/oracc/image/cache/P123.

The images div, with extension .img, lives in @@ORACC@@/p4.d/img in a
similar tiering to the eic and ooi directories.

PX and OOI:-
------------

PX looks for OOI images when the 'Image' link in the outline pane is
activated.

PX Image Popups:-
-----------------

PX has a helper script, pximages.sh, which sets up an images div
containing links to OOI or to external images (if the cache is enabled
it is checked before looking for external images).

A PX page builder can incorporate the image div, or it can be popped
up with an HTML wrapper via onload.

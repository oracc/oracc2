Tests File Format

Tests files live in tests/ and are tabbed files which have several
fields:

	ID	PX-ARGS		EXP	CHK

ID is a four digit number giving the ID of the command within the group.

PX-ARGS are the invocation arguments for PX; 'noh web=1' is always preprended.

EXP is the generator page name which is expected for the command.

CHK is a key for an XSLT script used to check the output structure
